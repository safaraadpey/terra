# Terra

**Terra** is the foundational semantic substrate that transforms the human-centric web
into a structured, meaningful, and directly executable environment for intelligent agents.

The web was built for humans: pages, visuals, interfaces, and interactions.
Terra turns the web into ground that intelligent systems can understand, traverse, and act upon.

## What Terra Is

Terra is not a browser.
It is not a crawler.
It is not a chatbot.

Terra is a **semantic ground layer** that sits beneath the web,
making existing websites readable and executable for AI systems
without requiring changes to those websites.

---

## Core Capabilities

Terra enables three fundamental capabilities:

### 1. Read  
Access and normalize web content beyond visual presentation.

### 2. Understand  
Translate web pages into structured semantic meaning using **WebML**  
(entities, relations, and actions).

### 3. Act  
Enable intelligent agents to perform real, controlled actions on the web
through an execution runtime.

## Core Concepts

### WebML — Web Meaning Layer  
A standardized semantic document format that maps web pages into:
- entities
- relations
- executable actions

WebML is how Terra understands the web.

### SemaLink — Semantic Connectivity  
The layer responsible for linking meaning across pages, domains, and contexts,
forming a navigable semantic graph.

### Actforge — Action Runtime  
The execution engine that allows intelligent agents to act on real web environments
in a controlled and auditable way.

## Project Status

🚧 **v0.1 — Foundation Phase**

Current focus:
- Fetch and normalize web content
- Generate WebML v1 documents
- Expose a minimal semantic API

Out of scope (for now):
- Autonomous agents
- Multi-step planning
- Large-scale crawling

## Documentation

- Whitepaper: `docs/whitepaper.md`
- Architecture: `docs/architecture.md`
- WebML Specification: `docs/webml-v1.md`
- Roadmap: `docs/roadmap.md`

## Vision

Terra is not a product.
It is not an application.

**Terra is the ground on which intelligent systems are built.**

A shared substrate where meaning is explicit,
actions are possible,
and intelligence can operate safely on the web.
